1.  UI Assignment (https://gearside.com/public-json-feeds/)

Build a SPA using the technology of your choosing (but be prepared to explain the reasons for your choices) that displays the titles and publish dates of the news articles returned from the JSON API located at http://www.stellarbiotechnologies.com/media/press-releases/json. The SPA should load and display more news articles as the user scrolls.  Accordingly, the API supports “limit” and “offset” parameters.

The assignment should take no more than a couple of hours, and while functionality is more important than form for this exercise we’re still expecting to see a clean user interface.
